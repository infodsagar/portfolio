        <span className='font-sans Segoe Print'>
          I created my first website at 16 but never thought of turning my hobby
          into a career until now. How technology has changed the world so far,
          and it will, is fascinating to me. Being part of the IT industry and
          contributing to that more significant cause excites me most. My
          primary expertise is making Web applications using React and
          JavaScript. Besides technology, I love visiting beaches while enjoying
          Australia's beautiful weather.
